id: a1b2c3d4-1111-4000-8000-000000000004
status: stable
description: |
    Detects usage of the AWS root account for any API operations. The root account
    should rarely be used and is a high-value target for attackers. Best practice
    is to use IAM users/roles with least-privilege access instead.
